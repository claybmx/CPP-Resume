// The public interface of a class is what the client programmer does see, so that is the most
// importante part of the class to get 'right' during analysis and design.
// If you don't get the interface right the first time, you can add more functions, as long
// as you don't remove any that client programmer have already used in their code. To avoid breakin'up his code.
